**Overview:** This project was inspired by Udemy course "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu.
  
In Section 17 of this version of the course they have you create a similar Dice Game. However,
the differences between my version and the one in the Udemy course are:
  - I added a button to play the game instead of hitting the refresh button
  - I created my own dice images in Figma instead of using the ones in the course
  - I styled it how I wanted to
  - I built my project from scratch not using any of the resources provided in the course
  - I added error handling checks just in case


**Project-Overview:** This program allows you to play a Dice Game that randomly rolls two dice. 

**Tools:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code
